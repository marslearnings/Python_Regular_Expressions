# The Curious Case of the Missing Code

John_Smith123 was panicking. It was 9:30 AM on April 15, 2025, and he had just realized that the crucial code files for Project-X2021 were missing from his laptop. Yesterday at 17:45, everything had been fine when he left the office at 42 Maple Street, Suite #301.

He quickly sent an email to his boss (anna.director@techcorp.com) and his team members (dev.team@techcorp.com):

Subject: URGENT - Missing Project Files
Body: Team, I can't locate the following files:
- main_v3.2.py
- config_prod.json
- api_keys.txt (IP: 192.168.1.100)

I've checked my backups from 2023-12-01 through 2025-03-15 but found nothing. Has anyone committed changes to the repository at http://git.techcorp.com/projects/x2021? My phone number is (555) 123-4567 if you need to reach me urgently. The project deadline is in 72 hours!

Lisa responded first at 9:42 AM: "I saved a copy at C:\Projects\Backup\X2021-backup.zip. The password is XB21-9$f5. You can also check with Mark who was working late yesterday."

John sighed with relief. Crisis averted! Now he needed to update the project documentation with proper file paths like /usr/local/bin/project-x/ for Linux users and C:\Program Files\Project-X\ for Windows users.

He made a note to call Lisa later at +1-555-987-6543 to thank her properly.
