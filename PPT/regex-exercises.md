# Regular Expression Exercises

Use the "The Curious Case of the Missing Code" text to answer the following questions. Create regular expressions that match exactly what's requested (nothing more, nothing less).

## Exercise 1: Basic Character Sets
1. Create a pattern that matches all instances of dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
2. Write a regex that finds all alphanumeric identifiers that contain both letters and numbers (like "John_Smith123" or "Project-X2021").
3. Match all times in the HH:MM AM/PM format.

## Exercise 2: Predefined Character Classes
4. Create a pattern using \d and \w to extract all phone numbers in the format (555) 123-4567 or +1-555-987-6543.
5. Write a regex using \s and \S to find all file paths (both Windows and Linux style).
6. Develop a pattern using \w, \d, and \s to match all file names with version numbers (like "main_v3.2.py").

## Exercise 3: Metacharacters and Alternation
7. Use the pipe operator (|) to match either email addresses or web URLs.
8. Create a pattern with the dot (.) metacharacter to find all text within parentheses.
9. Write a regex that matches IP addresses like 192.168.1.100.

## Exercise 4: Combined Challenge
10. Create a comprehensive pattern that extracts all forms of contact information (emails and phone numbers) from the text.
